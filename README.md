## ðŸ“’ **About**
> You know the rules: if a function is not allowed, you can't use it. It sucks right? Well, this is your chance to implement printf()! You'll be able to use it in the following projects, alongside with the other functions you developed so far.

## ðŸ“¦ **Compilation**
To compile so_long you should run `make` in the terminal.

This rule will generate a `so_long` file, which is the zipped version of all the object files. To launch the executable you should follow this syntax...

```sh
$ ./so_long path_to_the_map_file.ber
```

...where the second argument is the file you should use as input to display the map. Notice that any misconfiguration in the map file won't launch the graphical environment.

## ðŸ’« **Testing**

This project was tested using self-created map files to test extreme cases.
