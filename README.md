# **so_long**
This project was graded <strong>100/100</strong>.


## ðŸ“’ **About**
This project is one of the 3 possible graphical projects to develop in Rank 02. You'll learn about rendering, sprites, animations, color schemes and game development in 2D. One of the coolest projects in my opinion!

## ðŸš¨ **Disclaimer**
At 42, the C projects are built following a bunch of rules that enforce good coding style. Some of them are:

	- No for, do while, switch, case or goto are allowed
	- No more than 25 lines per function and 5 functions per file
	- No assigns and declarations in the same line (unless static)
	- No more than 5 variables in 1 function
	...

## ðŸ“¦ **Compilation**
To compile so_long you should run `make` in the terminal.

This rule will generate a `so_long` file, which is the zipped version of all the object files. To launch the executable you should follow this syntax...

```sh
$ ./so_long path_to_the_map_file.ber
```

...where the second argument is the file you should use as input to display the map. Notice that any misconfiguration in the map file won't launch the graphical environment.

## ðŸ’« **Testing**

This project was tested using self-created map files to test extreme cases.
